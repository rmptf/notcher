// authentication / next auth
Registration is the process of registering the user, saving new users' credentials into the database. It is independent of next-auth. You create a form, submit the form and save the form data properly into the database.
next-auth takes over when you are logged in, in other words, you are authenticated meaning that you are already a registered, genuine user. Once you pass the security checks and successfully logged in, next-auth creates a session for the user.
